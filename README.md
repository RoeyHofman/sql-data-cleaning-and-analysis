**# sql-data-cleaning-and-analysis
SQL project focused on data cleaning, analysis, and business insights based on sales and customer data.**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL workflow focused on data cleaning, analysis, and the extraction of actionable business insights.
The main goal of the project is to transform raw sales and customer data into a clean, reliable dataset and perform analytical queries that support reporting, decision making, and performance evaluation.
Special emphasis is placed on data quality, query readability, and analytical best practices commonly used in real-world data analytics projects.

**Dataset Description**

The analysis is based on 3 primary tables:

customer_info
Contains customer-level information, including registration date, region, loyalty tier, and customer category.

sales_data
Contains transactional data such as purchase date, product details, quantities, unit prices, discounts, payment methods, and delivery status.

product_info
Contains product_info-level information and product category.

**Step 1: Data Cleaning**

Before performing any analysis, the dataset was cleaned and standardized to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Key Data Cleaning Actions

Remove Duplicates
Duplicate records were identified and removed based on business-relevant columns to prevent inflated metrics and incorrect aggregations.

Standardize Data Formats
Inconsistent formats were normalized, including date fields, categorical values, and text casing, to enable accurate grouping and filtering.

Handle Null and Blank Values
Missing or empty values were carefully reviewed and either filled, removed, or flagged depending on their business impact.

Remove Unnecessary Columns
Columns not required for analysis or reporting were dropped to simplify the dataset and improve query performance.

Analytical Questions and Business Insights

After data preparation, multiple analytical queries were performed to answer key business questions.

1. Payment Method Analysis

    Identify the most frequently used payment method.

    Determine which payment method is most often associated with canceled shipments.

    Analyze the distribution of payment methods across different regions.

    Calculate total revenue generated by each region.

2. Revenue, Product, and Customer Analysis

    Analyze total revenue by product category.

    Identify the top 5 best-selling products.

    Identify the bottom 5 least-selling products.

    Determine which product received discounts most frequently.

    Identify the top 5 highest-value customers based on total revenue.

    Calculate total revenue by customer category.

    Measure the average time from customer registration to the first purchase.

    Calculate the average discount applied per product.

    Calculate the average selling price per product.

**Technical Highlights**

Use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to improve query readability and logical separation of analytical steps.
Use of aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, MIN, and COUNT.
Proper handling of date calculations using DATEDIFF.
Clear separation between data cleaning logic and analytical queries.
Queries written with readability and maintainability in mind.
